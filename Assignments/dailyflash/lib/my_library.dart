/// to use, import 'my_library.dart'.
///
/// (Note: since its a local library you can only access it in this project This is not a package so you cannot import it in your project.)
///
/// To run specific assignment use following template:
/// import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
/// import 'my_library.dart';
///
/// void main() {
///   runApp(const MainApp());
/// }
///
/// class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
///   const MainApp({super.key});
///
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     return const MaterialApp(
///       debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
///       home: AssignmentX(),
///     );      ^
///   }         |
/// }           |
///             |
///             |
/// In place of this `AssignmentX` use assignment number
///
/// for example: Assignment21
/// This lets you access first assignment(assignment1.dart) of Day_05
/// this value of `X`(21 in our case) can be calculated as
/// X = (number of day - 1)*5 + assignment number of that day
/// In our case number of day is 5 and assignment number of day 5 is 1
/// hence, X = (5 - 1)*5 + 1 = 21
